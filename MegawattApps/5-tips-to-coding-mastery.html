        <p class="article-image-caption">Sometimes there is a <em>best</em> solution in programming</p>
      </div>
      <p class="article-text">Programming is one of the more technical and complex skills where mastery is <em>almost</em> unobtainable due to its nature. In this guide, we will cover five quick and basic tips that will propel you to mastery. Reading through the tips will be easy, applying them in everyday practice will be difficult.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 1) Have a Purpose</h3>
      <p class="article-text">
      Before starting your journey in mastering programming, you need to have a reason of <em>why</em> you want to master programming. Simply saying "Just because" or "I have nothing else to do" is not enough. No one will ask you what your purpose is in mastering programming, keep it to yourself, but use your purpose as your internal motivator to keep you going in times of difficulty.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 2) Program for at least 5 Minutes Daily</h3>
      <p class="article-text">
      There's a reason why you become 'rusty' at things. Five years ago you might've been an expert at a certain subject, but five years later you barely remember anything since you haven't touched it in so long. If you program for at least five minutes a day, you can strengthen the circuitry in your mind that goes into programming, making you more skilled in the craft. If you go for even a few days without progrmaming, those connections become very slightly weaker. The more days you go without programming, the weaker you become at it. Of course at a high enough level, even if you haven't programmed in months, you would still be considered an expert despite not being at your peak.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 3) Read Programming Books Daily</h3>
      <p class="article-text">
      <center>"When I have money, I buy books; and if I have any left, I buy food and clothes." - Erasmus</center>
      </p>
      <p class="article-text">
      In 1819, it was considered illegal for black slaves to read. Frederick Douglas, who himself was a black slave, taught himself how to read and rose out of poverty. Reading is powerful. Aren't you amazed that you can look at this block of symbols and get meaning out of it? It's a highly valued and rewarding skill that not every takes full advantage of. Read and you will know.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 4) Work on Personal Programming Projects</h3>
      <p class="article-text">
      There's nothing that will improve your skill faster than applying your techniques in the real world, and there's no better way to do that than to work on a creative project. Work on something that results in an end product. This website for example, is a project of mine. It combines many skillsets into its creation, and I'm forced to think out of the box for many things. When you're working on a project, you make the rules. Theory sometimes doesn't work, and sometimes even the fundamentals are ignored.
      </p>
      <h3>Tip 5) Make Money Programming</h3>
      <p class="article-text">
      It is hard to continue a cft or hobby if it doesn't earn you any income. Earn money through programming and you will be motivated to do even more, to read more, to work on more personal projects, and so forth. Earn money through programming at work, side gigs, or your own personal projects, and you'll start doing more and more of it every day.
