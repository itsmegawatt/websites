      <p class="article-text">Doing computer work on a plane sucks. There's no Internet, you have a small amount of space to work in, and your time is limited by your computer's battery life.</p>
			<p class="article-text">I have found that despite these setbacks, you can still become quite productive on a plane, as long as you are completely prepared to be. Unlike working at home or in the office, you have to be fully prepared with a plan on exactly what you want to do if you want to get work done on a plane. I've sat through many plane rides with my laptop open, ready to do work, and then it turns out I'm missing a key file that can only be downloaded online, or maybe I just sat there with my computer open, not knowing what kind of work to do at all.</p>
			<p class="article-text">From the lessons I learned from over 80+ hours of travelling on a plane while <i>attempting</i> to do computer work, I've compiled a list of the most helpful tips to anyone wanting to do computer work on a plane.</p>
			<p class="article-text">Here are a list of tips to maximize the amount of work you get done on a plane:</p>
			<ul class="centered-ul">
				<li>Have your files ready: Make sure you download all the necessary files that you need to work with, this includes guides, emails, pdfs, images, etc.</li>
				<li>Have a plan: Know exactly what kind of work you want to get done on a plane. You're going to be stuck for 5+ hours sitting down, might as well dedicate all that time to work.</li>
				<li>Stick with economy class: Unlike in business class, you actually feel pressured to get work done sitting in cramped economy class seats.</li>
				<li>Absolute minimalist settings: You want to save battery life on a plane, and the best way to do that is to set brightness to nothing, have no unnecessary apps running, and disconnecting any external devices not in use. If you want to listen to music, listen to it from your phone instead.</li>
				<li>Get ear plugs: The noise from the turbines can be extremely loud and defeaning. Get ear plugs to not only help your concentration, but to preserve your hearing as well.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="article-text">Congratulations! You're now prepared to do any kind of work on a plane that comes your way.</p>
