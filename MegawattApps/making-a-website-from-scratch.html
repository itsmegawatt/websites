      <p class="article-text">Nearly 25% of all websites on the Web are powered by Wordpress (<a href="http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/wordpress-powers-quarter-worlds-websites-01141431">source</a>). Why on earth would anyone in this day and age, choose to make a website from scratch when there are so many easier options available out there? For example, a lot of 'web developers' that I know, actually use software such as Wordpress or Weebly to create their own 'websites'. These 'websites' that are created from templates and not from scratch, don't count as real websites.</p>
      <p class="article-text">When you copy and paste source code, you have no idea why the code was written the way it was, or why the website template is built the way it is. You're simply taking what's there, replacing some content, and voila, you call yourself a web developer. Sure your website might save you a week or more of coding time, and sure you might have an instantly cool looking website, but those are the only advantages that you get. Is the website <i>exactly</i> how you want it to look? Most likely not. Most likely, since you let someone else make the website for you, it's somewhat close to what you want it to look, but not quite exactly.</p>
      <p class="article-text">Compare that now, to writing the code for your very own website. When you make your website from scratch, yes you probably will spend more than a week tweaking the stylesheets over and over to make sure things are perfect, but you learn. You learn a lot. You have to experiment with certain code, and you play around with mixing and matching certain combinations of codes and styles before you get it to work the way you want it to, but once you do, you gain a <i>big</i> understanding of why things worked the way they did. I spent possibly 3 or more hours, trying to get the background to line up correctly with the footer. When you scroll down the website, the cool ocean background fixes itself to the footer of the website, and it creates this really cool grass-footer effect. It took me a long time to figure it out, but if I were to try and implement the same design to a different website, it would take me less than ten minutes to do the same thing.</p>
      <p class="article-text">As of this writing, this website is actually nowhere near complete. There's a lot of other pages to create, and a lot of new styles and designs to implement. There is no SEO at all on this website, no metadata has been added for keywords or descriptions. In fact, there is so far no javascript or any server-sided scripts at all on this website either. All of it so far was only written in HTML5 and CSS3, and yet there were still so many things accomplished. This website is a huge work in progress, but since it is being created from scratch, you know that everything on this website will work and look exactly how it was designed to.</p>
