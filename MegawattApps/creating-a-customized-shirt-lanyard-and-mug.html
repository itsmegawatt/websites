				What's the best way to let other people know about your company? The answer is to create awesome enough products that they go viral and a lot of people start using them. Another answer way down the list actually being close to one of the worst ways to advertise your company, is to create a T-Shirt with your logo on it and wear it. Okay if you're a celebrity and you wear a shirt that has your company name and logo on it, let's say you're Bill Gates and you only wore shirts that said Microsoft on it for example, okay you will get a lot of attention and a lot of page hits and so on. However if you're a nobody and you wear a shirt that says your unknown company's name and bears your unknown company's unknown logo, then no one will care. You will just be that guy that wears that random shirt nobody knows much about.

				Okay wow, so this shirt came out sort of cool looking. The only problem is that it looks unprofessionally built and instead looks so homemade because of the white borders around the website text. This shirt works if you're into that style, but we want to make awesome looking stuff here at Megawatt Apps, so this will not do!

				9/11/2015 Update: So the second version of the shirt was actually made and it came out looking cooler than the first, unfortunately it was misplaced somewhere and now it's gone forever :(.
